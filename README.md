# GA_prompt
Integration of Genetic Algorithms and Language Models

When utilizing our large language model for specific tasks, its performance isn't solely dependent on the model itself but also on the provided prompt. Consequently, multiple attempts might be necessary to discover a prompt yielding a satisfactory solution. Alternatively, implementing a genetic algorithm could facilitate this process by evolving initial prompts. Through automated iterations, this algorithm can eventually yield the most effective prompt discovered.
